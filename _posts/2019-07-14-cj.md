Ah Shit, Here We Go Again refers to a memorable scene from 2004 action-adventure video game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. Starting in April 2019, the scene gained significant popularity as an exploitable, often used in reference to repeating confrontations, although other meanings can also be derived depending on the context.

On October 24, 2004, action-adventure video game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, developed by Rockstar Games, was released for Playstation 2. Immediately following the opening cutscene, in which the main protagonist Carl "CJ" Johnson is harassed and blackmailed by corrupt police officers, the game starts with him finding himself in a hostile neighborhood.
