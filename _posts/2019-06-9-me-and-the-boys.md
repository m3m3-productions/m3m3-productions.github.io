Me and the Boys is a snowclone caption used in memes about various activities. Originally popular as a hashtag and a non-ironic caption, in early 2019 the phrase, paired with non-sequitur followups, gained popularity in /r/okbuddyretard subreddit and on Instagram, gaining mainstream attention with 60's Spider-Man villains variations in late May 2019.

While the exact origin of the phrase is unknown, before 2019 "Me and my boys" has been often used as a title for photograph posts on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Reddit and other social platforms (examples shown below). For example, on Instagram[1] over 26,500 posts tagged with the hashtag #meandtheboys could be found as of January 30th, 2019.
